name: pipeline-debug
version: 1.1.0
description: >-
  Reactive diagnostic skill for the SOMA pipeline (TI → HW → CR → Score Analyzer). Accepts a problem
  description, runs structured multi-dimensional checks, maps evidence to root cause via explicit
  IF-THEN rules, applies trivial fixes ONLY after explicit user confirmation (MUTATES production via
  as_patch_node_field), and delivers a prioritized debug report. Replaces 5–8 manual MCP calls with
  one structured investigation. Triggers: "pipeline-debug", "debug pipeline", "pipeline se srušio",
  "pipeline broke", "pipeline failed", "pipeline ne radi", "TI ne radi", "HW timeout", "CR ne radi",
  "prazan output", "empty output", "scores dropping", "quality dropped", "debug TI", "debug HW",
  "debug CR", "šta je pokvareno u pipeline-u", "zašto pipeline ne radi", "provjeri SOMA", "istražii
  grešku".

# Skill: pipeline-debug

*Version: 1.0.0*
*Grounded in: live MCP schema audit 2026-05-17, forensic plan review, confirmed tool*
*behaviours from agent-health-check and soma-memory-fix live sessions.*
*Zero values from memory. All tool parameter names confirmed from live schemas.*

---

## Purpose

Diagnoses why the SOMA pipeline (TI → HW → CR → Score Analyzer) failed or degraded.
Takes a problem description, runs targeted multi-dimensional checks, and returns:
- Root cause classification (from an explicit IF-THEN table — not LLM inference)
- Evidence for each finding
- Trivial fixes applied ONLY after explicit confirmation (see 10a.5)
- Manual fix instructions for non-trivial issues

**Key architectural fact (confirmed 2026-05-16):**
SOMA is an externally-orchestrated pipeline. `soma-run` skill calls agents via
`as_chat_with_agent` (human-to-agent). These are NOT A2A calls. Therefore:
- `as_list_agent_calls` / `as_get_agent_call_log` return 0 results for SOMA runs
- `as_get_recent_executions` IS the correct tool for SOMA execution history
- A2A tools are retained as supplementary checks for internal `call_agent` nodes only

---

## Hard rules — zero hallucination

- Root cause is determined ONLY by the explicit IF-THEN table in Step 9 — never by LLM inference
- Fix commands use ONLY node_ids and kb_ids obtained from live MCP calls in this session
- Apply a fix ONLY after (a) all Step 10 pre-conditions are met AND (b) the user explicitly confirms the exact patch — never without confirmation, never speculatively
- If a tool call fails → report UNKNOWN for that dimension, do NOT guess the result
- Evo-log parsing uses fixed field positions (documented below) — never free-form text analysis

---

## Confirmed constants (live-verified)

```
SOMA PRODUCTION SCOPE:
  Primary pipeline : Trend Intelligence (TI), Hook Writer (HW), Content Repurposer (CR)
  Secondary        : Score Analyzer (execution check only — no evo-log, different arch)

EVO-LOG PATHS (confirmed):
  TI  → agents/trend-intelligence/evo-log.md
  HW  → agents/hook-writer/evo-log.md
  CR  → agents/content-repurposer/evo-log.md

EVO-LOG PIPE-FIELD POSITIONS (0-indexed, confirmed from soma-run v1.1.0):
  TI fields: [0]date | [1]INPUT:... | [2]trend_found | [3]confidence | [4]angle | [5]triggered
  HW fields: [0]date | [1]trend | [2]platforms | [3]scores | [4]winner | [5]winner_score | [6]flags
  CR fields: [0]date | [1]trend | [2]platforms_completed | [3]scores | [4]flag | [5]notes

QUALITY TRIGGER KEYWORDS (case-insensitive):
  "quality", "scores", "score", "dropping", "evo-log", "UNSCORED",
  "violations", "hook quality", "platform", "degradation"

TIMEOUT TRIGGER KEYWORDS:
  "timeout", "slow", "stuck", "hanging", "waiting", "RUNNING", "ne odgovara"

CRASH TRIGGER KEYWORDS:
  "crashed", "failed", "FAILED", "error", "ne radi", "pokvareno", "srušio"

EMPTY OUTPUT TRIGGER KEYWORDS:
  "empty output", "prazan output", "ništa ne vraća", "blank", "nema outputa"

EXECUTION STATUS VALUES (confirmed from schema):
  as_get_recent_executions: PENDING | RUNNING | COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED

A2A CALL STATUS VALUES (confirmed from schema):
  as_list_agent_calls: SUBMITTED | WORKING | INPUT_REQUIRED | COMPLETED | FAILED

TIMEOUT ANOMALY THRESHOLD:
  If RUNNING status and duration > 5 minutes → classify as TIMEOUT

QUALITY DEGRADATION THRESHOLD:
  2 consecutive UNSCORED entries in HW evo-log → QUALITY_DEGRADATION
  OR cr_flag = "QUALITY_VIOLATIONS" in 2 of last 5 CR entries

TRIVIAL FIX ELIGIBILITY — apply ONLY after user confirmation (see Step 10):
  1. Missing outputVariable: only when the suggested fix resolves to a concrete
     node_id + field_name + field_value (see 10b); otherwise manual
  2. KB unwired (knowledgeBaseId missing) + exactly 1 KB exists for that agent
```

---

## STEP 0 — Task List

Create tasks before starting:
- "PARSE — Input analysis and symptom detection"
- "D0+D1 — Infrastructure and execution status"
- "D4+D5 — Flow integrity checks"
- "D6 — KB status"
- "D7 — Evo-log analysis (conditional)"
- "ROOT CAUSE — IF-THEN mapping"
- "CONFIRM & APPLY — propose trivial fixes, apply only after explicit user confirmation"
- "REPORT — Debug report"

Mark each `in_progress` before starting, `completed` when done.

---

## STEP 1 — Parse Input and Detect Symptom Profile

Extract from user's message:

### 1a — Agent scope
Detect if user named a specific agent:
- Mentions "TI" / "Trend Intelligence" → scope to TI (+ cascade check for HW/CR)
- Mentions "HW" / "Hook Writer" → scope to HW (+ check TI as upstream cause)
- Mentions "CR" / "Content Repurposer" → scope to CR (+ check HW as upstream)
- Mentions "Score Analyzer" → secondary scope only
- No specific agent → full SOMA scope (all 4 agents)

Store as `{debug_scope}`: `"TI"` / `"HW"` / `"CR"` / `"SCORE"` / `"FULL"`.

### 1b — Symptom type detection
Scan message for keyword groups (case-insensitive):

| Detected keyword group | Symptom type | D7 triggered? |
|---|---|---|
| Quality trigger keywords | `QUALITY` | Yes (Standard mode) |
| Timeout trigger keywords | `TIMEOUT` | No |
| Crash trigger keywords | `CRASH` | No |
| Empty output trigger keywords | `EMPTY_OUTPUT` | No |
| No keyword match | `UNKNOWN` | No (Deep only) |

Store as `{symptom_type}`. Store D7 flag as `{d7_in_standard}` = true/false.

### 1c — Time reference
If user mentions a specific time ("u 14:30", "sat ago", "zadnji run", "yesterday"):
- Store as `{time_reference}` = user-provided string
- Use as context note in report (cannot filter MCP calls by time — no timestamp filters on D1)
- If no time reference → use default: "last 10 executions per agent"

### 1d — Determine diagnostic depth
```
Default depth: STANDARD
Escalate to DEEP if (evaluated at end of Step 8):
  - STANDARD found 0 issues AND symptom_type != UNKNOWN (user reported a real problem)
  - STANDARD found only WARNINGs AND symptom_type = CRASH
  - All D0-D6 checks pass but user explicitly says "deep" / "detaljno" / "sve provjeri"
```

---

## STEP 2 — D0: Infrastructure Check

Mark task in_progress.

Call:
```
as_health_check()
```

Takes no parameters. Returns basic DB connection counts.

**Classification:**
- Call succeeded → `{d0_status}` = `REACHABLE`
- Call failed / exception → `{d0_status}` = `DOWN`

If DOWN → immediately halt all further steps. Report:
```
🔴 INFRA DOWN — MCP server cannot reach database.
No agent diagnostics possible. Check AgentStack MCP configuration.
```

If REACHABLE → proceed to Step 3.

---

## STEP 3 — D1: Execution Status Per Agent

Run all 4 agent checks **in parallel**:

```
as_get_recent_executions(agent_name: "Trend Intelligence",    limit: 10)
as_get_recent_executions(agent_name: "Hook Writer",           limit: 10)
as_get_recent_executions(agent_name: "Content Repurposer",    limit: 10)
as_get_recent_executions(agent_name: "Score Analyzer",        limit: 5)
```

For agents outside `{debug_scope}`, still run but mark as "context only" (to detect cascading).

For each agent, extract and store:
- `{agent}_last_status`: most recent execution status (COMPLETED / FAILED / RUNNING / PENDING / CANCELLED)
- `{agent}_last_timestamp`: timestamp of most recent execution (if available)
- `{agent}_consecutive_failed`: count of consecutive FAILED entries at top of results
- `{agent}_execution_count`: total executions returned (0 = never ran)
- `{agent}_has_running`: true if any execution has status=RUNNING

**Edge cases:**
- If tool call fails → `{agent}_d1_status` = `UNKNOWN` — continue with other agents
- If returns empty array → `{agent}_execution_count` = 0, `{agent}_last_status` = `NEVER_RAN`

### D1b — Supplementary A2A check (for internal call_agent nodes)

Call:
```
as_list_agent_calls(since_hours: 24, limit: 20)
```

This shows calls between agents via internal `call_agent` flow nodes. Useful if any SOMA
agent internally routes to another via `call_agent`. Store as `{a2a_calls}`.

If `{a2a_calls}` is empty → normal (SOMA is externally orchestrated). Do not flag.
If `{a2a_calls}` contains FAILED entries → note in report as supplementary finding.

---

## STEP 4 — D4: Static Flow Check

Call:
```
as_find_broken_flows()
```

Scans ALL agents for 4 known patterns:
1. `ai_response` with no `outputVariable` — result permanently lost
2. `ai_response` with empty prompt — model gets no instructions
3. `call_agent` targeting non-existent agent
4. `sandbox_verify` with mismatched `inputVariable`

Store full `issues` array as `{d4_issues}`.

Filter `{d4_issues}` to SOMA agents only (TI, HW, CR, Score Analyzer) for report.
Keep non-SOMA findings as informational only (don't include in SOMA report).

**Not from the schema:** `as_find_broken_flows` documents only that it "returns a list of issues per agent with severity and suggested fixes". Field names such as `.fix`, `.issue` and `.severity` are this skill's own shorthand for that response, NOT documented keys — read the actual response before indexing into it.
Store the `fix` string as-is for reference. It is a SUGGESTION of unspecified shape, not four named keys — see 10b before using it to build a patch.

---

## STEP 5 — D5: Flow Config Inspection

Run `as_inspect_flow` for agents that meet any of these conditions:
- Agent appears in `{d4_issues}` (broken flow detected)
- Agent has `{agent}_last_status` = FAILED or NEVER_RAN
- `{debug_scope}` targets this agent specifically
- All agents if `{debug_scope}` = FULL and ≥1 anomaly detected in D1/D4

Call per qualifying agent:
```
as_inspect_flow(agent_name: "<agent_name>")
```

Returns full `nodes[]` and `edges[]`.

For each agent inspected, extract:
- `{agent}_kb_search_nodes`: all nodes where `node.type == "kb_search"`
  - For each: `node.id`, `node.data.knowledgeBaseId` (null/empty = unwired)
- `{agent}_prompt_nodes`: all `ai_response` nodes
  - For each: `node.id`, `node.data.prompt` (empty string = broken)
- `{agent}_model`: model configured on main ai_response node
- `{agent}_input_mapping`: inputMapping config (for cascading analysis)

**What D5 checks that D4 does NOT:**
- `kb_search` nodes with missing `knowledgeBaseId` (KB unwired — auto-fixable)
- Prompt content that is technically non-empty but placeholder/incomplete
- Model configuration

---

## STEP 6 — D6: KB Embedding Status

Run for agents that have `kb_search` nodes (from D5) or are KB-based:
Primary KB agents (confirmed): Trend Intelligence, Hook Writer, Content Repurposer
Score Analyzer: check only if D5 reveals a kb_search node.

```
as_list_knowledge_bases(agent_name: "Trend Intelligence")
as_list_knowledge_bases(agent_name: "Hook Writer")
as_list_knowledge_bases(agent_name: "Content Repurposer")
```

For each, store:
- `{agent}_kb_embedding_status`: empty | processing | ready | partial_failure | failed
- `{agent}_kb_document_count`: total documents
- `{agent}_kb_id`: KB ID (needed for auto-fix in Step 10)
- `{agent}_kb_count`: number of KBs returned (0 = no KB at all)

**Cross-reference with D5:**
For each agent:
- If `kb_embedding_status` = empty AND `kb_search_nodes` exist → KB_DEAD (CRITICAL)
- If `kb_embedding_status` = empty AND no `kb_search_nodes` → KB_UNSEEDED (WARN)
- If `kb_count` = 0 AND `kb_search_nodes` exist → KB_MISSING (CRITICAL)

---

## STEP 7 — D7: Evo-log Pattern Analysis (Conditional)

**Run D7 if:**
- `{d7_in_standard}` = true (quality keywords detected in Step 1), OR
- Depth escalated to DEEP

**Skip D7 if:**
- `{d7_in_standard}` = false AND depth = STANDARD

### 7a — Read all three evo-logs (read-before-analyze)

```
obsidian_read_note("agents/trend-intelligence/evo-log.md")
obsidian_read_note("agents/hook-writer/evo-log.md")
obsidian_read_note("agents/content-repurposer/evo-log.md")
```

If any note returns "Note not found" → log as WARN: "Evo-log missing for {agent}."

### 7b — Parse HW evo-log for QUALITY_DEGRADATION

For each entry line in HW evo-log body (lines starting with "20" are entries):
1. Split by " | " (with spaces)
2. Extract field [6] (0-indexed) = `flags`
3. Build ordered list of last 5 entries: `hw_recent_flags[]`

**Detection rule:**
```
consecutive_unscored = 0
for entry in hw_recent_flags (newest first):
  if "UNSCORED" in entry.flags:
    consecutive_unscored += 1
  else:
    break

if consecutive_unscored >= 2:
  → set {hw_quality_degradation} = true
  → set {hw_unscored_count} = consecutive_unscored
```

### 7c — Parse CR evo-log for violation pattern

For each entry in CR evo-log (last 5):
1. Split by " | "
2. Extract field [4] = `flag`
3. Count entries where flag contains "QUALITY_VIOLATIONS"

If count >= 2 → `{cr_quality_violations}` = true.

### 7d — Parse TI evo-log for DRIFT pattern

For each entry in TI evo-log (last 5):
1. Split by " | "
2. Check if field [2] (trend_found) contains "[DRIFT from input]"
3. Count DRIFT occurrences

If count >= 2 → `{ti_drift_pattern}` = true (TI consistently redirecting from inputs).

---

## STEP 8 — Escalation Check

After Steps 2–7 complete, evaluate whether to escalate to DEEP:

```
issues_found = count of all CRITICAL + MAJOR findings so far

Escalate to DEEP if:
  a) issues_found == 0 AND symptom_type != "UNKNOWN"
     (user reported problem but Standard found nothing)
  b) issues_found > 0 AND all findings are WARN only AND symptom_type == "CRASH"
     (crash reported but only warnings found — something is hidden)
  c) User input contains "deep" / "detaljno" / "sve" / "full"

If escalating to DEEP:
  - Run D7 if not already run
  - Run as_get_agent_call_log for each SOMA agent (limit: 10, status omitted):
    as_get_agent_call_log(agent_name: "Trend Intelligence",    limit: 10)
    as_get_agent_call_log(agent_name: "Hook Writer",           limit: 10)
    as_get_agent_call_log(agent_name: "Content Repurposer",    limit: 10)
  - Run as_inspect_flow for ALL 4 SOMA agents (not just anomalous ones)
  Note: as_get_agent_call_log has no time filter — returns most recent N entries.
  Output preview is limited to 300 chars — useful for detecting empty/sentinel outputs only.
```

---

## STEP 9 — Root Cause Mapping (IF-THEN Table)

**CRITICAL: All root cause classification uses ONLY this table. No free-form LLM reasoning.**

Evaluate all rules. Multiple rules can fire simultaneously. Process in priority order.

### 9a — CRITICAL severity rules

```
RULE C1 — INFRA_DOWN
  IF d0_status == "DOWN"
  → Category: INFRA_DOWN | Severity: CRITICAL
  → Stop all other rules. Report infra issue only.

RULE C2 — FLOW_BROKEN (from D4)
  IF {agent}_appears_in d4_issues with severity != "WARN"
  → Category: FLOW_BROKEN | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: d4_issues[agent].issue
  → Fix source: the suggested-fix text for this issue — treat as a hint, not as
    four named keys; see 10b before building a patch from it
  → Apply after user confirmation (trivial-eligible) — see Step 10

RULE C3 — FLOW_BROKEN (from D4, WARN severity)
  IF {agent}_appears_in d4_issues with severity == "WARN"
  → Category: FLOW_BROKEN | Severity: MAJOR | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: d4_issues[agent].issue
  → Fix source: the suggested-fix text for this issue — see 10b
  → Apply after user confirmation (trivial-eligible) — see Step 10

RULE C4 — KB_DEAD
  IF {agent}_kb_embedding_status == "empty"
  AND {agent}_kb_search_nodes is non-empty (agent queries KB)
  → Category: KB_DEAD | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "KB empty AND kb_search node exists — agent runs without memory"
  → Fix: "Run kb-sync skill to seed KB"
  → Auto-apply: NO (kb-sync is a separate skill)

RULE C5 — KB_MISSING
  IF {agent}_kb_count == 0
  AND {agent}_kb_search_nodes is non-empty
  → Category: KB_MISSING | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "No KB exists AND kb_search node wired — agent queries non-existent KB"
  → Fix: "Create KB via agent-scaffolder, then run kb-sync"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE C6 — KB_FAILED
  IF {agent}_kb_embedding_status == "failed"
  → Category: KB_FAILED | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "KB embedding permanently failed — agent memory is broken"
  → Fix: "Delete and recreate KB, then reseed with kb-sync"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE C7 — KB_UNWIRED
  IF D5 reveals {agent}_kb_search_node with knowledgeBaseId null or empty
  AND {agent}_kb_count == 1 (exactly one KB exists)
  → Category: KB_UNWIRED | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "kb_search node exists but knowledgeBaseId is unset"
  → Fix: as_patch_node_field (node_id from D5, kb_id from D6)
  → Apply after user confirmation (trivial-eligible)

RULE C8 — AGENT_FAILED (consecutive)
  IF {agent}_consecutive_failed >= 3
  → Category: AGENT_FAILED | Severity: CRITICAL | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "{N} consecutive FAILED executions"
  → Fix: "Check flow config (D5) and KB status (D6) for this agent"
  → Auto-apply: NO
```

### 9b — MAJOR severity rules

```
RULE M1 — TIMEOUT
  IF {agent}_has_running == true AND any RUNNING execution duration > 5 min
  → Category: TIMEOUT | Severity: MAJOR | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "Agent has RUNNING execution exceeding 5 minutes"
  → Fix: "Increase timeout on call_agent node; check if web search is hanging"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE M2 — CASCADING
  Cascade detection (requires at least 2 agents checked):
  IF ti_last_status == "FAILED"
  AND (hw_execution_count == 0 OR hw_last_timestamp < ti_last_timestamp)
  → Category: CASCADING | Severity: MAJOR
  → Evidence: "TI failed; HW has no subsequent executions → pipeline blocked at TI"
  → Primary: TI fix (from C2/C3/C8/M1 rules above)
  → Note: "Fix TI first — HW and CR failures are downstream consequences"

  IF ti_last_status == "COMPLETED"
  AND hw_last_status == "FAILED"
  AND (cr_execution_count == 0 OR cr_last_timestamp < hw_last_timestamp)
  → Category: CASCADING | Severity: MAJOR
  → Evidence: "TI OK; HW failed; CR has no subsequent executions → pipeline blocked at HW"
  → Primary: HW fix

RULE M3 — AGENT_FAILED (single)
  IF {agent}_consecutive_failed == 1 OR == 2
  → Category: AGENT_FAILED | Severity: MAJOR | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "{N} recent FAILED executions"
  → Fix: "Review D5 flow config; may be transient — retry pipeline"
  → Auto-apply: NO
```

### 9c — WARNING severity rules

```
RULE W1 — KB_UNSEEDED
  IF {agent}_kb_embedding_status == "empty"
  AND {agent}_kb_search_nodes is empty (agent does NOT query KB)
  → Category: KB_UNSEEDED | Severity: WARN | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "KB exists but empty; no kb_search node — not operationally blocking"
  → Fix: "Seed KB via kb-sync when ready to enable memory"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W2 — KB_PROCESSING
  IF {agent}_kb_embedding_status == "processing"
  → Category: KB_PROCESSING | Severity: WARN | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "KB embedding in progress — temporary state"
  → Fix: "Wait 60s and re-run pipeline-debug"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W3 — KB_DEGRADED
  IF {agent}_kb_embedding_status == "partial_failure"
  → Category: KB_DEGRADED | Severity: WARN | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "Some KB documents failed embedding — memory partially degraded"
  → Fix: "Run kb-sync to re-upload failed documents"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W4 — QUALITY_DEGRADATION (HW)
  IF hw_quality_degradation == true (from D7)
  → Category: QUALITY_DEGRADATION | Severity: WARN | Agent: HW
  → Evidence: "{hw_unscored_count} consecutive UNSCORED entries in HW evo-log"
  → Fix: "Check HW prompt (D5) for score output format; check KB for instincts freshness"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W5 — QUALITY_DEGRADATION (CR)
  IF cr_quality_violations == true (from D7)
  → Category: QUALITY_DEGRADATION | Severity: WARN | Agent: CR
  → Evidence: "Repeated QUALITY_VIOLATIONS in CR evo-log"
  → Fix: "Check CR instincts.md via kb-sync; update banned phrase list"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W6 — NEVER_RAN
  IF {agent}_execution_count == 0 (NEVER_RAN)
  AND {agent} is in debug_scope
  → Category: NEVER_RAN | Severity: WARN | Agent: {agent}
  → Evidence: "No execution records found — agent may never have been triggered"
  → Fix: "Run soma-run to trigger the pipeline"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W7 — DRIFT_PATTERN (TI)
  IF ti_drift_pattern == true (from D7)
  → Category: DRIFT_PATTERN | Severity: WARN | Agent: TI
  → Evidence: "TI consistently redirecting from provided inputs to different trends"
  → Fix: "Review TI prompt and instincts — consider whether drift is intentional"
  → Auto-apply: NO

RULE W8 — REPAIR_NOT_PERSISTED
  IF hw_last_status == "COMPLETED" (hw-validator passed — gate returned "PASS")
  AND cr_quality_violations == true (CR blocked on banned phrases in D7)
  AND D5 reveals hw-validator node whose code contains SUBS map or BN_REP repair phase
  AND call_agent-cr inputMapping uses {{hw_payload}} (the processor outputVariable)
  AND no write-back function node exists between hw-validator and hw-gate
  → Category: REPAIR_NOT_PERSISTED | Severity: WARN | Agent: HW→CR cascade
  → Evidence: "hw-validator repairs payload in-memory but returns 'PASS' only — call_agent-cr sends {{hw_payload}} (original, unrepaired) to CR"
  → Fix: "Add hw-payload-writeback function node (outputVariable: 'hw_payload') between hw-validator and hw-gate. Re-wire: hw-validator → hw-payload-writeback → hw-gate. Gate and call_agent-cr unchanged."
  → Auto-apply: NO (requires as_update_flow with new node + edge rewiring — not a patch_node_field fix)
```

### 9d — CLEAN result
```
IF no rules fired above:
  → {root_cause} = CLEAN
  → Report: "No issues detected across all checked dimensions."
  → If symptom_type != UNKNOWN: escalate to DEEP (Step 8 trigger)
```

---

## STEP 10 — Apply Trivial Fixes (after explicit confirmation)

Eligible fixes from Step 9 are applied ONLY after the user confirms the exact patch (see 10a.5). This step **MUTATES production** via `as_patch_node_field`.

**Trivial = eligible to apply AFTER explicit user confirmation:**
1. RULE C2/C3 (FLOW_BROKEN from D4): ONLY where the suggested fix resolves to a
   concrete `node_id` + `field_name` + `field_value` — see 10b. If it does not,
   the issue is non-trivial and goes to the manual list.
2. RULE C7 (KB_UNWIRED): `as_patch_node_field` with live IDs from D5 + D6

**Non-trivial = NEVER applied by this skill.** These override the C2/C3
eligibility above: if a D4 issue is one of these, it is manual regardless of
severity — the D4 scan covers empty prompts and phantom call_agent nodes, and
both appear here.

- Empty prompt (needs human content)
- Wrong model value (needs target from user)
- KB empty/failed (needs kb-sync — different skill)
- Phantom call_agent (needs deletion decision)
- Ambiguous KB (2+ KBs — same rule as soma-memory-fix)

### 10a — Pre-fix safety checks (per agent to fix)

Before touching any agent:

1. **Active execution guard:** Check `{agent}_has_running`. If true → SKIP this agent.
   Log: "⚠️ {agent} is currently RUNNING — skipping auto-fix to avoid race condition."

2. **Pre-patch re-read:** Call `as_inspect_flow(agent_name: "{agent}")` to confirm
   condition still exists. If condition resolved (another process fixed it) → SKIP.
   Log: "ℹ️ {agent}: condition already resolved. Skipping."

### 10a.5 — Confirmation gate (MANDATORY before any patch)

Before any `as_patch_node_field` call, present every planned patch to the user:
`{agent_name, node_id, field_name, old_value → field_value}` for each eligible fix.
Ask: *"Apply these N flow patches to production? (da / yes)"*.

- **Fail‑closed:** if the user does not explicitly confirm, apply NOTHING — report all eligible fixes as `PROPOSED (awaiting confirmation)` and stop the apply phase.
- One confirmation may cover the whole batch; record it before proceeding.

### 10b — Apply FLOW_BROKEN fix (from D4)

```
as_patch_node_field(
  agent_name: "<from d4_issues>",
  node_id:    "<node.id from an as_inspect_flow call made THIS session>",
  field_name: "<from d4_issues>",
  field_value: "\"<from d4_issues>\""
)
```

**`field_value` must be a JSON literal.** The schema states it "is parsed as JSON"
and gives these forms: `'"my-variable"'` (string), `'0.7'` (number), `'true'`
(boolean), `'{"key":"value"}'` (object). So:
- an id or any string value carries inner quotes — `'"cmxyz..."'`
- a number does NOT — `'15'`, not `'"15"'`
- a string containing newlines, `"` or `\` must be JSON-**escaped**, not merely
  wrapped. This matters for prompt fields: a raw prompt wrapped in quotes is
  invalid JSON.

The schema does not document what happens when `field_value` fails to parse — it
says only that "changes are applied directly to the database". So a malformed
value may be rejected OR stored raw; do not assume either. Because 10d's
post-patch verify compares the field to the value you sent, a raw-stored bad
value can read back as a match. Verify the node's field against the intended
value, not against the string you passed.

**Do not treat `d4_issues[agent].fix` as structured data.** `as_find_broken_flows`
returns "a list of issues per agent with severity and suggested fixes" — the `fix`
field is a suggestion string of unspecified shape, not four named keys. If you
cannot read `node_id` and `field_name` off it unambiguously, do NOT invent them:
obtain `node_id` from an `as_inspect_flow` call in this session, and abort the
patch if `field_name` is still ambiguous. Inventing either one while believing the
"live IDs only" rule was honoured is exactly the failure that rule exists to stop.

### 10c — Apply KB_UNWIRED fix (from D5+D6)

```
as_patch_node_field(
  agent_name: "<agent_name>",
  node_id:    "<node.id from D5 as_inspect_flow>",
  field_name: "knowledgeBaseId",
  field_value: "\"<kb id from D6 as_list_knowledge_bases>\""
)
```

Only if `{agent}_kb_count` == 1. If 0 or 2+ → skip, report as manual.

### 10d — Post-patch verification

After each patch, re-read to confirm:
```
as_inspect_flow(agent_name: "<agent_name>", node_type: "<patched_node_type>")
```

- If field now has expected value → mark as `FIXED ✅`
- If field still empty → mark as `VERIFY_FAILED ❌` — log error, report for manual follow-up
- If field has unexpected value → mark as `VERIFY_MISMATCH ❌` — do NOT overwrite, report

### 10e — Track results
```
{auto_fixes_applied}   = list of FIXED nodes
{auto_fixes_failed}    = list of VERIFY_FAILED / VERIFY_MISMATCH
{auto_fixes_skipped}   = list of skipped (running agent / ambiguous)
```

**If CLEAN (no issues found):**
```
✅ No issues detected across all {N} dimensions checked.
{If symptom reported}: Escalating to DEEP diagnostic...
```

**If auto-fixes were applied:**
```
⚡ {N} trivial fix(es) applied after confirmation. Recommend re-running soma-run to verify pipeline health.
```

**If DEEP mode ran:**
```
📋 DEEP mode: reviewed call log previews (300-char limit) for output content.
   Useful for: detecting empty outputs, abort sentinels.
   Not useful for: quality analysis, score patterns (use D7 evo-log for those).

## Diagnostic Dimension Summary

| Dim | Tool | What it finds | SOMA-specific note |
|---|---|---|---|
| D0 | `as_health_check` | DB connectivity | Returns basic counts only |
| D1 | `as_get_recent_executions` × 4 | Execution history per agent | PRIMARY tool for SOMA (external orchestration) |
| D1b | `as_list_agent_calls` | A2A internal calls | Supplementary — usually empty for SOMA |
| D4 | `as_find_broken_flows` | 4 static flow patterns | Does NOT check KB wiring |
| D5 | `as_inspect_flow` | Full config: prompts, model, KB wiring | KB wiring check done here |
| D6 | `as_list_knowledge_bases` | KB embedding status | Cross-referenced with D5 |
| D7 | `obsidian_read_note` × 3 | Evo-log quality patterns | Conditional on symptom type |

**MCP call count (corrected):**
```
STANDARD (no quality trigger):
  D0(1) + D1(4) + D1b(1) + D4(1) + D5(0–4) + D6(0–3) = 7–13 calls, ~90s

STANDARD (quality trigger, D7 added):
  +3 obsidian reads = 10–16 calls, ~2min

DEEP:
  All above + as_get_agent_call_log × 3 + full D5 × 4 = max 22 calls, ~4min
```

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Parameters used | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `as_health_check` | none | Returns basic counts only |
| `as_get_recent_executions` | `agent_name`, `limit`, optional `status` | PRIMARY execution check |
| `as_list_agent_calls` | `since_hours`, `limit` | A2A only — supplementary |
| `as_get_agent_call_log` | `agent_name`, `limit`, optional `status` | A2A only, no time filter |
| `as_find_broken_flows` | none (optional `public_only`) | 4 patterns, all agents |
| `as_inspect_flow` | `agent_name`, optional `node_type` | Full flow config |
| `as_list_knowledge_bases` | `agent_name` | KB status per agent |
| `as_patch_node_field` | `agent_name`, `node_id`, `field_name`, `field_value` (JSON literal — see 10b) | Apply only after 10a.5 confirmation |
| `obsidian_read_note` | `path` | Evo-log analysis |

**Excluded tools and reasons:**
- `as_get_heartbeat_status`: requires exact `agent_id` — needs extra as_list_agents call for minimal value
- `as_get_kb_embedding_status`: redundant — `as_list_knowledge_bases` already returns full status breakdown
- `as_diagnose_models`: covered by agent-health-check scope, not needed reactively

## Constraints Summary

| Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|
| Root cause | ONLY from IF-THEN table in Step 9 — never LLM inference |
| Fix IDs | ONLY from live MCP calls in current session — never from memory |
| Apply after confirmation | ONLY trivial fixes (C2/C3 from D4, C7 with 1 KB) — never without 10a.5 |
| Auto-apply guard | Check RUNNING status + pre-patch re-read before every patch |
| Post-patch verify | Always re-read to confirm patch took effect |
| A2A tools | D1b only — never as primary SOMA diagnostic |
| D7 trigger | Quality keywords in input → Standard; otherwise → Deep only |
| CONFIG_DRIFT | Not a category — cannot detect without config baseline |
| Score Analyzer | D1 check only — no evo-log, no auto-fix, secondary scope |
| 300-char limit | Call log output preview detects empty/sentinel outputs only |
| Time filter | as_get_recent_executions has no time filter — always last N records |
